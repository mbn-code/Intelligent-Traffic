# Intelligent Traffic

Car simulation for a school project.
Each car will spawn in a lane that is not occupied, the first car will get a green light and the others will wait if its being occupied by another car. If nothing is occupied it will just be given a green light.
This is an example of a "intelligent" lightning system for traffic, where instead of the lights being time based, they will update based on cars coming to minimize the time spend waiting for red lights and ex polluting the enviorment while the car is at a hold.
